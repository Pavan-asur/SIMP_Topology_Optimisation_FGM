The codes presented here are use for the following paper "SIMP Phase field topology <optimisation framework to maximise fracture resistance in FGMs". 
The codes are divided intp 2 parts.
1. Without phase field to minimise the compliance.
2. With Phase field method to fracture to maximise fracture resistance. 
The main codes are in "eso_crack", and the properties of the FGM has to be changed in "crack_propogation". 

The basic Framework for the codes are developed by Prof. Julien Yvonnet (Gustave Effiel Univeristy, Paris)(julien.yvonnet@univ-effiel-fr), 
and Prof. Qi Chang He (Qi-chang.he@u-pem.fr).
